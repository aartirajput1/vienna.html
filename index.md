### Past meetups

**2016**

#### \#6 - Tuesday, November 22nd

- **Markdown in Action: Building Courses (incl. Presentations, Pages, Handouts) for the Web and Print (PDF) w/ kramdown (webgen+Prawn)**  [(Sample Course)](http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~praxis/sosem16/vorlesung.html) by [Thomas Leitner](speakers#thomas.leitner)
    - Summary: How do you create presentation slides for a course and provide the information in various formats? The most obvious way would probably
      be to use a tool like Microsoft PowerPoint or LibreOffice Impress which can export the slides as handouts. However, this is a manual process
      where some steps can be forgotten. And the whole thing is not really web friendly.

      There are other ways if you are a hacker and tinkerer. We like to
      automate things. By using Markdown as the source format

      * we can easily produce HTML slides using one of the various
        Javascript presentation solutions,
      * provide the contents as a normal HTML pages for easy searching
        and online viewing, and
      * provide a print friendly output format, in this case PDF.

      In this talk Thomas will show you how to combine the static website
      generator webgen, the Markdown library kramdown and the PDF generation
      library Prawn to do these things.
